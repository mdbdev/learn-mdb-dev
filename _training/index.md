## MDB Training Program
Welcome to the comprehensive training program that encompasses the essentials of mobile app development using both native iOS technologies and React Native, along with foundational concepts in machine learning. This course is designed to equip you with the skills needed to build robust mobile applications and incorporate machine learning functionalities. Whether you're interested in iOS-specific development or cross-platform solutions, this program will provide you with the knowledge and tools to succeed in the modern tech landscape.

## Course Structure
The program consists of three main modules:

### React Native Development:
Learn to develop cross-platform mobile apps using React Native with a single codebase in TypeScript. This module will cover backend architecture, database paradigms, systems design, wireframing, authentication paradigms, and extending React Native concepts to web and desktop applications.

### iOS App Development:
This module focuses on building iOS apps using native Apple technologies. You'll explore modern programming paradigms, concurrency, memory management, database design, and more.

### Introduction to Machine Learning:
This module introduces the basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and practical applications in mobile apps. You will learn how to integrate machine learning models into your apps and use them for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

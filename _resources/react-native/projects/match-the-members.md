## Project Description
Welcome to MDB! This semester, we’ll have over 70 members, including a new recruit class of 10 of the brightest minds on campus. What better way to get to know everyone in the club than to build an app about them? We’ll be building a simple, multiple-choice trivia game to see how fast you can learn everyone’s names.

You will be working alone for this project.

## Starter Code
The starter code is available at [this link](https://google.com/). Here are the commands to get started.

```
git clone https://github.com/mdbdev/reactnative-mp1.git
cd reactnative-mp1
expo install
expo start
```
The starter code contains a framework for getting started, including a Home Screen and a Game Screen. You'll be making all of your changes to `GameScreen.jsx`.

Here are other files that you should read over:

- `App.js` - serves as the entry point of the application. Defines the app navigation stack.
- `HomeScreen.jsx` - contains the HomeScreen, which is the landing page of the app.
- `GameScreen.jsx` - contains the GameScreen, which is where the game is played.
- `Styles.js` - contains the CSS stylesheet for the app.
- `Constants.js` - contains the list of all MDB members.

Otherwise, just move on to the next question. | Answer Display - You can go from one question to another just by changing the image and button values, but there should be a one second delay in between questions where the button the user pressed flashes either red or green (depending on whether they’re correct or not). You’ll have to look up how to implement timers. | Timer - Add a timer that limits the user to 5 seconds to answer the question. If they take up the full 5 seconds, the question is counted as incorrect. | . For this project, the starter code provides you with a fair amount of structure.

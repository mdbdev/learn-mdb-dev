Instead of starting with the same starter code as everyone else and working towards the same end product, you’ll be working together in teams of two to create a unique product, with an opportunity to dive deep into to areas that interest you!

    "content": "Requirement 1: Create a Functional MVP . What is a MVP? It’s described formally as a “version of a new product a team uses the maximum amount of learning about customers with the least effort.” In other words, we want to take as many shortcuts as we can to get a version of a working product into the hands of our customers. Then, we observe their interactions with our product, and use that learning to guide our decisions in the future. Coming up with a viable app idea is difficult - so we’ve done the work for you! For this project, you can choose from any of the ideas listed in the Appendix. If you have your own idea, feel free to work on that as well - just make sure to run it by your mentor first! Because this is a three week project, we want all ideas to be somewhat on an equal level of difficulty, so we’ve designed the requirements as such. Requirement 2: Use the Expo SDK . The Expo SDK allows us to interface directly with device hardware and native functionality, and offers support for integration with nearly 50 platform-specific features. Your app must implement one of the following modules from the Expo SDK: . Accelerometer, Appearance (e.g. Dark Mode), AsyncStorage, Audio, AV, BarCodeScanner, Barometer, Calendar, Camera, Contacts, DeviceMotion, FaceDetector, Location, MailComposer, MapView, MediaLibrary, Sensors, Sharing, SMS, Video, WebBrowser .

    "title": "Tracks",
    "content": "Track 1: Design Track . Choose this track if you want to learn more about design! In this track, you’ll have the ability to focus primarily on the design of your application. You must create and submit a Figma mockup before jumping into your application - with careful thought given to application UI/UX. For design inspiration, we recommend checking out Dribbble (create an account and search for “mobile app”). Figma is a drag-and-drop tool for designing visual interfaces. Figma also supports functionality to view CSS for components crated using the editor, which might help translate your designs into code! . If you choose this track, you don’t have to implement every single screen of your complete design - feel free to focus on the screens that are the most important, and feel free to cut out functionality to meet the bare minimum working product! . Track 2: Backend Track . Choose this track if you want to learn more about backend architecture, including setting up a NodeJS backend server! For this track, we recommend using a component library (e.g. React Native Paper) to minimize the amount of time you have to spend designing your application. Additionally, you must do one of the following: . | Set up and deploy an Express/NodeJS server on Heroku, and use it in some way in your app. | Set up and deploy a Javascript (recommended) or Python Firebase/Google Cloud Function, and use it in some way in your app. | . One of the most frequent ways to use one of these servers is to create an orchestration layer between your client and your backend database or dataset. This “orchestration layer” receives requests from your client, and makes the appropriate request to a database or other endpoint. Then, it receives data back and transforms it into a structure that’s easier for the app to consume directly. ",

I love biking, playing badminton and I had been playing ice hockey for five years before coming to college. I cook almost every day: mostly Chinese food but I do occasionally try to make other stuff too. I’m an international student from China so I speak native mandarin (which is also why there’s probably gonna be lots of typos in what you are about to see: I had to run it through Grammarly twice to make sure I don’t make stupid mistakes). But anyway, I’m super excited to have you all this semester and I assure you it’s gonna be great! . To start things off, I know the TOC looks scary, but I promise you this is only gonna be the first week. iOS dev is awesome. However, it does come with a little bit of a learning curve. Be patient and be sure to ask question! Also special thanks to our two mentors this semester: Ian and Janvi.

For the following Swift Tutorial, it might be helpful to try out some of the expressions yourself. In that case, you can use a Swift Playground. It’s a place where you can conveniently run your Swift code and it’s mainly used as an educational tool. To create a Swift Playground, you will first need to set up and launch Xcode. When you are on this screen, go to the top-left menu bar and select File &gt; New &gt; Playground.. When Xcode asks you to choose a template, double click Blank. For the file location, my experience is you can keep it anywhere you like, but if you are using iCloud storage, do NOT put any Xcode files or projects in the folder that’s using iCloud (generally that would mean Desktop and Documents).

This also allows you to declare a variable or constant without initializing it. However, it will not be usable until you give it a value (even nil). var name: String name = “Oski” . If you do not specify a type, Swift can infer it from the value it was initially assigned to. This is known as type inference. Swift is a strongly-typed language.

Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations. Array . The type of a Swift array is written in full as Array&lt;Element&gt;, where Element is the type of values the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand form as [Element]. Therefore, an array can be declared like this . var libraries: [String] = [\"Moffitt\", \"Main Stack\", \"EAL\"] . Retrieve or modify a value from the array by using a subscript. var firstItem = libraries[0] libraries[1] = \"Music Library\" . Append a new value by calling the append(_:) method . libraries.append(\"Engineering Library\") . Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator += . libraries += [\"Law Library\", \"Bancroft\"] . Dictionary . The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;, where Key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys. You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as [Key: Value]. Therefore, a dictionary can be declared like this . var distance: [String: Double] = [\"Moffitt\": 0.9, \"Main Stack\": 1.0, \"EAL\": 1.1] print(\"The dictionary contains \\(distance.count) items.\") // Prints \"The dictionary contains 3 items.\" . Similar to arrays, you can retrieve or modify a value from the dictionary using subscript. distance[\"Main Stack\"] = 1.3 distance[\"Moffitt\"] . However, there is no append(_:) method in dictionary. To add a new value, simply use the subscript. distance[\"Music Library\"] = 1.5 . Set . The type of a Swift set is written as Set, where Element is the type that the set is allowed to store. Sets do not have an equivalent shorthand form. A set can be created with an array literal. var libraries: Set&lt;String&gt; = [\"Moffitt\", \"Main Stack\", \"EAL\"] . You can insert an element by calling the set’s insert(_:) method. To check whether a set contains a particular item, use the contains(_:) method. ",

You can chain multiple if statement together using else if and else . if condition { statements } else if { statements } else { statements } . You can combine multiple predicates using the logical operator ! || &amp;&amp;. For single-expression if statements, you can usually simplify them with the ternary operator . condition ? expression : expression . If the condition is true, the first expression will be executed and its return value would be the return value of the whole statement. A simple example can look like this . var feel: String = temp &gt; 75 : \"hot\" : \"ok\" . For-In Loops . You use the for-in loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in an array, ranges of numbers, or characters in a string. let names: [String] = [\"Anna\", \"Alex\", \"Brian\", \"Jack\"] for name in names { print(\"Hello, \\(name)!\") } . You can also use in to iterate through a dictionary. That would give you all of its key-value pairs. let numberOfLegs: [String: Int] = [\"spider\": 8, \"ant\": 6, \"cat\": 4] for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs { print(\"\\(animalName)s have \\(legCount) legs\") } .

You would then call the function using its name and parameter, which will return a String. var answer1: String = answer(question: \"Question 1\") . For each parameter, you can also specify its label, and it will be used when you are calling the function. This helps to create easier to read function calls like this. func answer(for question: String) -&gt; String { } var answer1: String = answer(for: \"Question 1\") . By default, the argument labels are the same as the parameter names, and will be used when calling the function like in answer(question: \"Question 1\").

You can create multiple instances of that house with the same blueprint, but the interior design which is the data is going to be different. Each house operates on its own, but they all share the same structure and behaviors. In Swift, classes are declared using the class keyword. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your classes using the same syntax you use to define constants, variables, and functions. class User { var username: String = \"\" var email: String = \"\" func printEmail() { print(email) } } . A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class. When one class inherits from another, the inheriting class is known as a subclass, and the class it inherits from is known as its superclass. class Admin: User { managedUsers: [User] = [] } . The value assigned with property declarations are the default values that will be assigned during class initialization. If no default value is specified, a custom initializer is needed. class Admin: User { managedUsers: [User] init(withManagedUsers users: [User]) { self.managedUsers = users super.init() } } . Members of an class (either a property or a method) can be accessed using the dot notation .. let user = User() let user.email = \"example@domain.com\" . ",

    "content": "In Swift, structures and classes have very similar functionalities. Both of them can define properties and methods, conform to protocols, and be extended using an extension (we will talk about the last two in the next lesson). struct Event { var eventName: String var startTime: Date var endTime: Date // Initializer } . However, there are a few key differences too: . | Classes can inherit from another class and/or conform to one or more protocols whereas structures can only conform to protocols. | Classes are reference types whereas structures are value types. Semantically, a value type is a type whose value is copied when it’s assigned to a variable or constant, or when it’s passed to a function. This is also the reason why, in the example above for dot notation, we were able to assign an user instance to a let constant and still be able to change its stored value email. Because when reassigning email, the underlying reference in user hasn’t changed. But if User is defined as a struct, let user would then be representing a value instead of a reference. Then changing the email would be considered mutating that value, which is not allowed for a constant. (Fun fact: I was actually asked about this during interview with Apple!) | . ",

    "title": "Optionals",
    "content": "Optional is a special type in Swift. It is used with another type and adds nil to the possible values of that type. In short, it handles the absence of a value. For example, an optional String means there’s either a String, or there’s no value at all. A regular, non-optional type cannot be nil. var name: String? = nil name = \"🐻\" . The process to retrieve the value from an optional is called unwrapping. In general, there are many ways of unwrapping an optional, but we will focus on three of the most common ones today. Force Unwrapping . Force unwrapping is the most straightforward way of unwrapping an optional. It is done by adding ! to the end of a variable. var name: String? = nil name = \"🐻\" var nameNonOptional: String = name! . However, force unwrapping will crash your code if the optional is nil. So in practice, you should force unwrap only when you’re sure it’s safe. As a side note, it is possible to define optional values without having to unwrap them every time in order to use them. let name: String! = nil name = \"🐻\" . This is called implicitly unwrapped optional. The optional values defined using this method behave as if they were already unwrapped. But if you try to use them when they are nil, your code will crash. This is commonly used for variables that start as nil, but will always have a value before you need to use it. Optional Binding . You use optional binding to find out whether an optional contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant or variable. var name: String? = nil name = \"🐻\" if let nameNonOptional = name { print(\"The name is \\(nameNonOptional)\") // The name is 🐻 } else { print(\"Name not available\") } . Multiple values can be bound in a single if-let statement. Each statement is separated using a comma. In the following example, failable initializer Int(_:) returns an optional integer Int?. var startStr = \"2\", endStr = \"10\" if let startDay = Int(startStr), let endDay = Int(endStr) { print(\"Span: \\(endDay - startDay) days\") } . You can also use regular boolean expression in an if-let. For example, if we want to print only when the day difference is more than 0: . if let startDay = Int(startStr), let endDay = Int(endStr), endDay &gt; startDay { print(\"Span: \\(endDay - startDay) days\") } . Early Exit . A guard statement behaves very similarly to an if statement. It uses a boolean expression to determine whether to continue executing code in a function or transfer control to exit the code. In another word, guard checks for requirements in a specific line of code. let calendar = NSCalendar.current // Friday? guard calendar.component(.weekday, from: Date()) == 6 else { return } print(\"Smash Bros 🎮 🎉\") . However, the reason why guard is introduced here is that it’s most commonly used with let to create a conditional binding that’s available in the same block scope, and it works pretty much the same as the if-let statement. var startStr = \"2\", endStr = \"10\" guard let startDay = Int(startStr), let endDay = Int(endStr), endDay &gt; startDay else { return } print(\"Span: \\(endDay - startDay) days\") .

    "title": "View Controllers and Views",
    "content": "The first main concept we are going to introduce here is the view controller. View controllers are the foundation of your app. Every app has at least one view controller, and most apps have several. It manages components of your app’s interface called views as well as the interactions between that interface and the underlying data. View controllers are like screens. For example, when switching between tabs, you are switching between different view controllers. So in essence, They are the building blocks of your app’s navigation. You create your custom view controller through subclassing the build-in UIViewController class from the UIKit framework. In the following example, we declare a view controller called HomeViewController and set its backgroundColor to red. import UIKit class HomeViewController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemRed } } . Custom view controllers are usually named XXXViewController or XXXVC for short. Just like any other type in Swift, you should always use UpperCamelCase when naming view controllers. There should be only one view controller in each file, and the name of the file should be View Controller's Name.swift. View Management . The most important role of a view controller is to manage a hierarchy of views. Every view controller has a single root view that encloses all of the view controller’s content. To that root view, you add the subviews you need to display your content. The parent view of a subview is also called the superview. You access a view controller’s root view through the self.view property (or just view where self pointer can be omitted). All view components in UIKit are subclasses of the UIView class, which defines the behaviors that are common to all views. You can add subview to any view using the addSubview(_:) method. Life Cycle . A view controller comes with a set of methods that manage its view hierarchy. iOS automatically calls these methods at appropriate times when a view controller transitions between states. These transitions are known as the Life Cycle Events. When you create a view controller subclass, it inherits the methods defined in UIViewController and lets you add your own custom behavior for each method. One method you’ve seen so far is viewDidLoad(). It’s called after the views in a view controller are created and loaded into memory. Since this usually only happens once in the view controller’s entire lifecycle, viewDidLoad() is commonly used for styling, adding subviews, and creating and activating constraints. Other life cycle methods such as viewDidAppear(), viewWillAppear(), viewWillDisappear() and etc., can be called multiple times depending on how the view controller behaves. You define the custom behaviors for a lifecycle event by overriding the default implementation of the corresponding lifecycle method. override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemRed } . Note: Although superclass implementation in super.viewDidLoad() doesn’t do anything, it’s a good habit to call super for all functions you override that don’t have a return value. ",

    "doc": "Lesson 0",
    "title": "First Custom View",
    "content": "As you’ve learned in the previous section, the build-in viewDidLoad() is useful for many one-time setups including styling and adding subviews. However, although it is possible to create, style, and add subview entirely using viewDidLoad(), it is not recommended for many reasons: . | As your UI grows more complex, viewDidLoad() tends to get very bloated, which is bad for readability. | If you want to keep a reference of the views created, you’d have to declare an optional instance variable which initializes to nil, then fill in the value in viewDidLoad(). | . Therefore, it is common to defer some of that setup to the initialization phase before viewDidLoad() kicks in. Conveniently, Swift allows us to initialize a variable along with the declaration using a closure, which is kinda like the lambda expression in Python. Recall that in Python we can write tiny, “anonymous” functions like this . lambda x, y: x * y . and in Swift, the equivalent closure can look like this . { x, y in return x * y } . We will formally introduce closure in our next lesson, but for now let’s just stick to the notion that it’s just a portable function that can be called and passed around. In this video, we will see how to use this pattern to create a UILabel and add it to the rootview. Frames . In the last video we used something called frame to create our UILabel, and you probably already have a little idea what that’s for. UILabel(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 88, width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width, height: 60)) . In UIKit, the position of a view is described by a point-based coordinate system. It starts from the top left of the referencing view (0, 0) and ends at the bottom right. A frame is a rectangle that defines the size and position of the view in its superview’s coordinate system. In the example above, we used UIScreen.main.bounds because the root view has the same frame as the screen. In fact, we can use view.bounds.width and the effect would’ve been the same. But we will then have to set our frame in viewDidLoad because self.view (or in particular, self) isn’t available in the instance initialization phase. welcomeLabel.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 88, width: view.bounds.width, height: 60) . Note: The difference between frame and bounds is detailed in -this article. One thing to keep in mind is that for UILabel, changing the frame will not affect the physical size of the label, unless the frame causes it to overflow. This is because the frame only specifies a rectangle to which we put our view in. The size of the label itself is controlled by its font size, which was set through UILabel.font and was 27 points in our last example. However, if we set the background color to something we will be able to see, resizing the frame does change the way it looks. AutoLayout and Constraints . Although using frame seems clean and definitive, it does come with quite a few drawbacks: . Since different iOS devices may have different screen sizes (iPhone 12 Pro Max: 428×926 points; iPhone XR: 414×896 points), aligning the views can be tedious and oftentimes tricky. Most of the time it often involves computing all the values dynamically. For example, if we want our 200×70 label to be at the center of every screen, we would have to do this . let width = 200 let height = 70 let x = (UIScreen.main.bounds.width - width) / 2 let y = (UIScreen.main.bounds.height - height) / 2 label.frame = CGRect(x: x, y: y, width: width, height: height) . | .

Instead of starting with the same starter code as everyone else and working towards the same end product, you’ll be working together in teams of two to create a unique product, with an opportunity to dive deep into to areas that interest you!

    "content": "Requirement 1: Create a Functional MVP . What is a MVP? It’s described formally as a “version of a new product a team uses the maximum amount of learning about customers with the least effort.” In other words, we want to take as many shortcuts as we can to get a version of a working product into the hands of our customers. Then, we observe their interactions with our product, and use that learning to guide our decisions in the future. Coming up with a viable app idea is difficult - so we’ve done the work for you! For this project, you can choose from any of the ideas listed in the Appendix. If you have your own idea, feel free to work on that as well - just make sure to run it by your mentor first! Because this is a three week project, we want all ideas to be somewhat on an equal level of difficulty, so we’ve designed the requirements as such. Requirement 2: Use the Expo SDK . The Expo SDK allows us to interface directly with device hardware and native functionality, and offers support for integration with nearly 50 platform-specific features. Your app must implement one of the following modules from the Expo SDK: . Accelerometer, Appearance (e.g. Dark Mode), AsyncStorage, Audio, AV, BarCodeScanner, Barometer, Calendar, Camera, Contacts, DeviceMotion, FaceDetector, Location, MailComposer, MapView, MediaLibrary, Sensors, Sharing, SMS, Video, WebBrowser .

    "title": "Tracks",
    "content": "Track 1: Design Track . Choose this track if you want to learn more about design! In this track, you’ll have the ability to focus primarily on the design of your application. You must create and submit a Figma mockup before jumping into your application - with careful thought given to application UI/UX. For design inspiration, we recommend checking out Dribbble (create an account and search for “mobile app”). Figma is a drag-and-drop tool for designing visual interfaces. Figma also supports functionality to view CSS for components crated using the editor, which might help translate your designs into code! . If you choose this track, you don’t have to implement every single screen of your complete design - feel free to focus on the screens that are the most important, and feel free to cut out functionality to meet the bare minimum working product! . Track 2: Backend Track . Choose this track if you want to learn more about backend architecture, including setting up a NodeJS backend server! For this track, we recommend using a component library (e.g. React Native Paper) to minimize the amount of time you have to spend designing your application. Additionally, you must do one of the following: . | Set up and deploy an Express/NodeJS server on Heroku, and use it in some way in your app. | Set up and deploy a Javascript (recommended) or Python Firebase/Google Cloud Function, and use it in some way in your app. | . One of the most frequent ways to use one of these servers is to create an orchestration layer between your client and your backend database or dataset. This “orchestration layer” receives requests from your client, and makes the appropriate request to a database or other endpoint. Then, it receives data back and transforms it into a structure that’s easier for the app to consume directly. ",

Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations. Array . The type of a Swift array is written in full as Array&lt;Element&gt;, where Element is the type of values the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand form as [Element]. Therefore, an array can be declared like this . var libraries: [String] = [\"Moffitt\", \"Main Stack\", \"EAL\"] . Retrieve or modify a value from the array by using a subscript. var firstItem = libraries[0] libraries[1] = \"Music Library\" . Append a new value by calling the append(_:) method . libraries.append(\"Engineering Library\") . Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator += . libraries += [\"Law Library\", \"Bancroft\"] . Dictionary . The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;, where Key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys. You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as [Key: Value]. Therefore, a dictionary can be declared like this . var distance: [String: Double] = [\"Moffitt\": 0.9, \"Main Stack\": 1.0, \"EAL\": 1.1] print(\"The dictionary contains \\(distance.count) items.\") // Prints \"The dictionary contains 3 items.\" . Similar to arrays, you can retrieve or modify a value from the dictionary using subscript. distance[\"Main Stack\"] = 1.3 distance[\"Moffitt\"] . However, there is no append(_:) method in dictionary. To add a new value, simply use the subscript. distance[\"Music Library\"] = 1.5 . Set . The type of a Swift set is written as Set, where Element is the type that the set is allowed to store. Sets do not have an equivalent shorthand form. A set can be created with an array literal. var libraries: Set&lt;String&gt; = [\"Moffitt\", \"Main Stack\", \"EAL\"] .

A simple example can look like this . var feel: String = temp &gt; 75 : \"hot\" : \"ok\" . For-In Loops .

You can create multiple instances of that house with the same blueprint, but the interior design which is the data is going to be different. Each house operates on its own, but they all share the same structure and behaviors. In Swift, classes are declared using the class keyword. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your classes using the same syntax you use to define constants, variables, and functions. class User { var username: String = \"\" var email: String = \"\" func printEmail() { print(email) } } . A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class. When one class inherits from another, the inheriting class is known as a subclass, and the class it inherits from is known as its superclass. class Admin: User { managedUsers: [User] = [] } . The value assigned with property declarations are the default values that will be assigned during class initialization. If no default value is specified, a custom initializer is needed. class Admin: User { managedUsers: [User] init(withManagedUsers users: [User]) { self.managedUsers = users super.init() } } .

However, there are a few key differences too: . | Classes can inherit from another class and/or conform to one or more protocols whereas structures can only conform to protocols. | Classes are reference types whereas structures are value types. Semantically, a value type is a type whose value is copied when it’s assigned to a variable or constant, or when it’s passed to a function. This is also the reason why, in the example above for dot notation, we were able to assign an user instance to a let constant and still be able to change its stored value email. Because when reassigning email, the underlying reference in user hasn’t changed. But if User is defined as a struct, let user would then be representing a value instead of a reference. Then changing the email would be considered mutating that value, which is not allowed for a constant. (Fun fact: I was actually asked about this during interview with Apple!) | . ",

    "title": "Optionals",
    "content": "Optional is a special type in Swift. It is used with another type and adds nil to the possible values of that type. In short, it handles the absence of a value. For example, an optional String means there’s either a String, or there’s no value at all. A regular, non-optional type cannot be nil. var name: String? = nil name = \"🐻\" . The process to retrieve the value from an optional is called unwrapping. In general, there are many ways of unwrapping an optional, but we will focus on three of the most common ones today. Force Unwrapping . Force unwrapping is the most straightforward way of unwrapping an optional. It is done by adding ! to the end of a variable. var name: String? = nil name = \"🐻\" var nameNonOptional: String = name! . However, force unwrapping will crash your code if the optional is nil. So in practice, you should force unwrap only when you’re sure it’s safe. As a side note, it is possible to define optional values without having to unwrap them every time in order to use them. let name: String! = nil name = \"🐻\" . This is called implicitly unwrapped optional. The optional values defined using this method behave as if they were already unwrapped. But if you try to use them when they are nil, your code will crash. This is commonly used for variables that start as nil, but will always have a value before you need to use it. Optional Binding . You use optional binding to find out whether an optional contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant or variable. var name: String? = nil name = \"🐻\" if let nameNonOptional = name { print(\"The name is \\(nameNonOptional)\") // The name is 🐻 } else { print(\"Name not available\") } . Multiple values can be binded in a single if-let statement. Each statement is separated using a comma. In the following example, failable initializer Int(_:) returns an optional integer Int?. var startStr = \"2\", endStr = \"10\" if let startDay = Int(startStr), let endDay = Int(endStr) { print(\"Span: \\(endDay - startDay) days\") } . You can also use regular boolean expression in an if-let. For example, if we want to print only when the day difference is more than 0: . if let startDay = Int(startStr), let endDay = Int(endStr), endDay &gt; startDay { print(\"Span: \\(endDay - startDay) days\") } . Early Exit . A guard statement behave very similarly to an if statement. It uses a boolean expression to determine whether to continue executing code in a function or transfer control to exit the code. In another word, guard checks for requirements in a specific line of code. let calendar = NSCalendar.current // Friday? guard calendar.component(.weekday, from: Date()) == 6 else { return } print(\"Smash Bros 🎮 🎉\") . However, the reason why guard introduced here is because it’s most commonly used with let to create conditional binding that’s available in the same block scope, and it works pretty much the same as the if-let statement. var startStr = \"2\", endStr = \"10\" guard let startDay = Int(startStr), let endDay = Int(endStr), endDay &gt; startDay else { return } print(\"Span: \\(endDay - startDay) days\") .

Instead of starting with the same starter code as everyone else and working towards the same end product, you’ll be working together in teams of two to create a unique product, with an opportunity to dive deep into to areas that interest you!

    "content": "Requirement 1: Create a Functional MVP . What is a MVP? It’s described formally as a “version of a new product a team uses the maximum amount of learning about customers with the least effort.” In other words, we want to take as many shortcuts as we can to get a version of a working product into the hands of our customers. Then, we observe their interactions with our product, and use that learning to guide our decisions in the future. Coming up with a viable app idea is difficult - so we’ve done the work for you! For this project, you can choose from any of the ideas listed in the Appendix. If you have your own idea, feel free to work on that as well - just make sure to run it by your mentor first! Because this is a three week project, we want all ideas to be somewhat on an equal level of difficulty, so we’ve designed the requirements as such. Requirement 2: Use the Expo SDK . The Expo SDK allows us to interface directly with device hardware and native functionality, and offers support for integration with nearly 50 platform-specific features. Your app must implement one of the following modules from the Expo SDK: . Accelerometer, Appearance (e.g. Dark Mode), AsyncStorage, Audio, AV, BarCodeScanner, Barometer, Calendar, Camera, Contacts, DeviceMotion, FaceDetector, Location, MailComposer, MapView, MediaLibrary, Sensors, Sharing, SMS, Video, WebBrowser .

    "title": "Tracks",
    "content": "Track 1: Design Track . Choose this track if you want to learn more about design! In this track, you’ll have the ability to focus primarily on the design of your application. You must create and submit a Figma mockup before jumping into your application - with careful thought given to application UI/UX. For design inspiration, we recommend checking out Dribbble (create an account and search for “mobile app”). Figma is a drag-and-drop tool for designing visual interfaces. Figma also supports functionality to view CSS for components crated using the editor, which might help translate your designs into code! . If you choose this track, you don’t have to implement every single screen of your complete design - feel free to focus on the screens that are the most important, and feel free to cut out functionality to meet the bare minimum working product! . Track 2: Backend Track . Choose this track if you want to learn more about backend architecture, including setting up a NodeJS backend server! For this track, we recommend using a component library (e.g. React Native Paper) to minimize the amount of time you have to spend designing your application. Additionally, you must do one of the following: . | Set up and deploy an Express/NodeJS server on Heroku, and use it in some way in your app. | Set up and deploy a Javascript (recommended) or Python Firebase/Google Cloud Function, and use it in some way in your app. | . One of the most frequent ways to use one of these servers is to create an orchestration layer between your client and your backend database or dataset. This “orchestration layer” receives requests from your client, and makes the appropriate request to a database or other endpoint. Then, it receives data back and transforms it into a structure that’s easier for the app to consume directly. ",

This also allows you to declare a variable or constant without initializing it. However, it will not be usable until you give it a value (even nil). var name: String name = “Oski” . If you do not specify a type, Swift can infer it from the value it was initially assigned to. This is known as type inference. Swift is a strongly-typed language.

Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations. Array . The type of a Swift array is written in full as Array&lt;Element&gt;, where Element is the type of values the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand form as [Element]. Therefore, an array can be declared like this . var libraries: [String] = [\"Moffitt\", \"Main Stack\", \"EAL\"] . Retrieve or modify a value from the array by using a subscript. var firstItem = libraries[0] libraries[1] = \"Music Library\" . Append a new value by calling the append(_:) method . libraries.append(\"Engineering Library\") . Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator += . libraries += [\"Law Library\", \"Bancroft\"] . Dictionary . The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;, where Key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys. You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as [Key: Value]. Therefore, a dictionary can be declared like this . var distance: [String: Double] = [\"Moffitt\": 0.9, \"Main Stack\": 1.0, \"EAL\": 1.1] print(\"The dictionary contains \\(distance.count) items.\") // Prints \"The dictionary contains 3 items.\" . Similar to arrays, you can retrieve or modify a value from the dictionary using subscript. distance[\"Main Stack\"] = 1.3 distance[\"Moffitt\"] . However, there is no append(_:) method in dictionary. To add a new value, simply use the subscript. distance[\"Music Library\"] = 1.5 . Set . The type of a Swift set is written as Set, where Element is the type that the set is allowed to store. Sets do not have an equivalent shorthand form. A set can be created with an array literal. var libraries: Set&lt;String&gt; = [\"Moffitt\", \"Main Stack\", \"EAL\"] . You can insert an element by calling the set’s insert(_:) method. To check whether a set contains a particular item, use the contains(_:) method. ",

You can combine multiple predicates using the logical operator ! || &amp;&amp;. For single-expression if statements, you can usually simplify them with the ternary operator . condition ? expression : expression . If the condition is true, the first expression will be executed and its return value would be the return value of the whole statement. A simple example can look like this . var feel: String = temp &gt; 75 : \"hot\" : \"ok\" . For-In Loops . You use the for-in loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in an array, ranges of numbers, or characters in a string. let names: [String] = [\"Anna\", \"Alex\", \"Brian\", \"Jack\"] for name in names { print(\"Hello, \\(name)!\") } . You can also use in to iterate through a dictionary.

You would then call the function using its name and parameter, which will return a String. var answer1: String = answer(question: \"Question 1\") . For each parameter, you can also specify its label, and it will be used when you are calling the function. This helps to create easier to read function calls like this. func answer(for question: String) -&gt; String { } var answer1: String = answer(for: \"Question 1\") . By default, the argument labels are the same as the parameter names, and will be used when calling the function like in answer(question: \"Question 1\").

Each house operates on its own, but they all share the same structure and behaviors. In Swift, classes are declared using the class keyword. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your classes using the same syntax you use to define constants, variables, and functions. class User { var username: String = \"\" var email: String = \"\" func printEmail() { print(email) } } .

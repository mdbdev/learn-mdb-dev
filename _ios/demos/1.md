# Setup

For all of the mini-projects and demos we will be using Git for source control. For that, you will need to have a [Github](http://github.com/) account. If you need a refresher on the Terminal commands, you can check out a cheat sheet [here](https://gist.github.com/poopsplat/7195274).

## Create a Github Repo

First go to your [Github](http://github.com/) and login to your account. On the left you should see the option to create a new repo.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-create.png"
    alt="Create Github Repo"
    style="width: 442px; display: block; margin: auto;" />

In the dialogue, pick a name for your repository. For example, it could be something like `MDB-iOS-Projects`. By the end of this semester, this can be your training program portfolio! Either public or private repo is fine. You do not need to initialize it with README, .gitignore, or license.

After clicking create, your remote repo will be ready. You should see a URL ending with `.git`, this will be the remote reference of your repository.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-url.png"
    alt="Create Github URL"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Copy the URL. In your Terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to store your local repo (wondering how to do that? Check out the [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/poopsplat/7195274)). Then run the following command to clone the remote repo
```shell
git clone [your_repo_url.git] [Local folder name of your choice]
cd [Local folder name of your choice]
```
It's gonna show a warning that you have cloned an empty repository, which is expected because we haven't add anything to it yet. Let's quickly change that by adding a readme to the folder.
```shell
echo "# My first commit" >> example.md
```
This will create a file called `example.md` and append the string `"# My first commit"` to that file. However, we also need to register this change with Git. This is called *commit*. Think of it as creating a save point in game, so no matter how badly you mess up, you can always go back (well, most of the time :)).
```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "Added README.md"
```
Now if you run `git log`, you can see the commit you've made so far. 

Before we push the change to Github, let's make sure that the primary branch name follows the new standard (use `main` instead of `master`).

```shell
git branch -M main
```

Since this is the first time branch `main` is pushed to `origin` (the alias for your `repo_url.git`), we should also create the remote branch and make our local branch track that remote branch. So the next time we push, we can simply say `git push` rather than explicitly write out the full name `git push origin main`.
```shell
git push -u origin main
```
In output it should say something like this 
```text
...
To some url
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```
Use `git open` to open the repository on Github, you should be able to see the `example.md` you just created.

## Get the Starter Code

Open a Terminal window, navigate to your local repository for the mini-projects. Run the following command
```shell
git remote add starter https://github.com/Miclin1024/MDB-iOS-TP.git
git pull starter fa21/students/main  --allow-unrelated-histories
```
This should open your default CLI text editor asking you to confirm the merge. If you've never done anything to change it before, it should be `vim`.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-merge.png"
    alt="Create Github URL"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />
_The content of the screenshot is outdated, but it should look similar._

Type in `:wq` to save and exit (vim commands will appear at the bottom). If you accidentally enter the `Insert` mode, press `esc` to return to the command mode then press `:wq`.

Use `ls` to confirm that the folder `Hackshop 1` is in the repository. You can open a Finder window using command `open .`. Inside the folder you will find two set of code: a starter version and a completed version. We encourage you to follow along using the starter code during hackshop.

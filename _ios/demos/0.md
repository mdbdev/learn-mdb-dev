# Set Up

The following commands will assume that you have finished the setup for mini-project 1. If you haven't started MP1, please first follow the set up section [here](/ios/projects/0/#setup) before moving on.

Navigate to your local MDB iOS TP repo
```shell
cd ...
```
then run
```shell
git pull starter main
```
Just like in the project, if a merge window appears, you can use `:wq` to save and exit (assuming that you use `vim`).

Check the folder and see if it contains a folder named `Hackshop 1`. Inside the folder you will find two set of code: a starter version and a completed version. The completed version has all the comments and everything. But we recommend that you try to follow through with the starter and the video first.

# The Video

Since we don't have Hackshop next Monday, the demo is replaced with a 45-min video walkthough!

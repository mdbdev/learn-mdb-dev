# Introduction

Congratulations, this is the last Mini-Project of the iOS Training Program. Over the past few weeks, you have learned an incredible amount of iOS and general programming knowledge, and this project will be a chance to showcase all of it before the development cycle. You will be building a weather application using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

# Setup

First, use this command to get the starter code.

```shell
git pull starter main
```

## Using OpenWeatherMap APIs

Go to [OpenWeatherMap API](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and sign up for an account.

Then go to [My API Key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys), copy the key under the name *default*, and paste it into `Secret.plist` insider the `Support File` folder.

Now you can make API request via the `WeatherRequest` class provided in the starter code.

# Specs

This project will be highly design focused. We want you to employ your knowledge in lesson four and five to create not only a functional weather app, but one with an simple, aesthetic, and effective user interface. The specs will only specify the features that you need to implement, so the design is entirely up to you.

## Displaying Weather Data

For weather data, you must display at least the following information:
- City or region name
- Current temperature
- Feels like temperature
- The current weather condition
    - We'd like you to be creative with this one. You can use an icon, background, animation, etc. *Displaying the condition in plain text will receive 50% credits.*
    - A full list of weather conditions can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions#Weather-Condition-Codes-2)
- The atmospheric pressure and humidity level.

## Weather at the Current Location

The app must be able to use the user's location to display weather at the current location. However, the rest of the app should still behave reasonably even when the location is unavailable (no signal, user did not authorized, etc.). The information should update automatically when the user change their location without having to relaunch the app. Note: You can control your device's location with the "Simulate Location" tool.

    style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Weather for Other Saved Locations

The app should allow the user to search, add, and remove locations from a collection. These locations should persist after the app is terminated and relaunched. When the user is searching for the new location, a list of matching cities or regions should appear, and automatically updates as the user types. (Check out [Google Place API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview))

## "One More Thing"

Choose one feature from the following list to implement:
- Display temperatures from nearby cities on a map (You can use [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/) or [Google Map SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/overview)).
- Make a Firebase cache for the API so your app can be fast and scale without hitting the 60/min request limit.
- Integrate with Siri.
- Build a simple widget for weather at the current location.
- Support dark and light mode. The color theme should follow the system settings.
- Vector animations with [Lottie](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/) and Adobe AE + Bodymovin.
- Send a local notification about the current weather at a scheduled time ( See [`UNUserNotificationCenter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter)).

# Introduction

This week we will be building an app called MDBSocials which will allow members to post and RSVP to social events. We will be exploring the Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Storage APIs in the Firebase SDK. As we mentioned, there are lots options out there for building backend and database for an iOS app. We opted for Firebase because it's lightweight, easy to learn, and it can scale up automatically (if you are willing to pay).

The combination of these technologies (server, backend, APIs, etc.) is what's know as the tech stack. If you are interested in this topic, here's a great YouTube video I found:

# Setup

## Starter Code

As usual, use this command to get the starter code
```shell
git pull starter fa22/student/main
```

We will be using Firebase Auth, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Storage for this mini-project. You should all have received an email invitation to collaborate on the firebase project. 

## Google Service Info Plist

To ensure that our data is only reachable by those who have access, Firebase use a `GoogleServiceInfo.plist` file to store all the tokens used to authenticate our app when communicating with the Firebase APIs. Therefore, to keep our API key safe, this file should always be excluded from the repository (by adding its name to `.gitignore`) and you will have to download it directly from Firebase. To get a copy of this file, you will go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and open the project page.

    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Click the iOS app button that says "dev.mdb.social". This is the bundle identifier of our app. Then click the gear icon.

    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Under the project settings page, click the `GoogleService-Info.plist` download button.

    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

After that's done, you will move the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project's root folder as shown in the picture. 

Go back to Xcode, under the project navigator, you should see the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file name turning from red to white, indicating that the file is now resolving correctly.

Run the app and make sure that you see the login screen. *The build process can take about 2-5 minutes depending on your machine.*

Finally, check if you can login using the dummy account.
```text
email: test@mdb.dev
password: 963258741
```

You can use the x button to go back to the authentication screen.

# Spec

## Requirements

You are allowed to use storyboards. Though we still strongly recommend you create most of your UI programmatically.

As always, good quality design is an expectation. Feel free to look at existing apps for inspiration. We will especially be looking for great design on this project so once you finish, please spend time improving your design.

Make sure your code is clean and easily readable. See [this](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) for a Swift style guide.

## Sign Up

- The user should be brought to this screen when they tap the sign up button in the login page. Require the user to input their full name, email, username, and password when signing up. Also have a second password field to use as confirm. Your app should display an error when they don't match.

- Once the user has filled out all the necessary info, they should tap the sign up button on this screen and be redirected to the `FeedNavigationVC`, which uses a `FeedVC` as its root view controller. You should follow the example in the sign in page.

- The sign up should be done using the Firebase Auth service. See the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/start) for more details.

- When a user signs up, the app needs to first register the user with Firebase Auth, then use the `uid` returned from Firebase Auth to write the additional user information into [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/). 

- We have provided some firebase boilerplate code in the `Authentication` and `Database` class. Make sure to follow MVC when adding the sign up. We will be checking closely for any violations!

- Your sign up page needs to notify the users of some common errors. You are free to support as many as you want, but the one's that are required are: email in use, weak password, passwords don't match, and missing input fields.

- UI fluidity matters! Remember to show activity indicator when the sign up is still loading.

- Note: We have added security rules to check if the request you send to Firebase is legal (credit to Allison for writing all the rules!!). If you are getting access errors when writing to/reading from firebase, double check if the information you are requesting to read/add makes sense. (e.g. Access to full account info should only be granted to the corresponding user).

## Feed

We will also implement a small portion of the feed feature.

- Display a list of socials where each cell contains the following information:
    - name of member who posted
    - name of event
    - picture of event
    - number of people who RSVP'd "interested"
- Socials should be displayed in order of most recent to oldest

# Submission

Save all the files in your project, commit, and push to Github.

# Project Description

Welcome to MDB! This semester, we’ll have over 50 members, including a new recruit class of 18 of the brightest minds on campus. What better way to get to know everyone in the club than to build an app about them? We’ll be building a simple, multiple-choice trivia game to see how fast you can learn everyone’s names.

You will be working alone for this project.

# Setup

For all of the mini-projects we will be using Git for source control, and you will need to have a [Github](http://github.com/) account. If you need a refresher on the Terminal commands, there's a cheat sheet [here](https://gist.github.com/poopsplat/7195274).

## Create a Github Repo

First go to your [Github](http://github.com/) and login to your account. On the left you should see the option to create a new repo.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-create.png"
    alt="Create Github Repo"
    style="width: 442px; display: block; margin: auto;" />

In the dialogue, pick a name for your repository. For example, it could be something like `MDB-Mini-Projects`. You can make it either public or private. You do not need to initialize it with README, .gitignore, or license.

After clicking create, your remote repo will be ready. You should see a URL ending with `.git`, this will be the remote reference of your repository.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-url.png"
    alt="Create Github URL"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Copy the URL. In your Terminal, first navigate to the directory where you want you local repo to be located (wondering how to do that? Check out the [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/poopsplat/7195274)). Again, do not use a directory that's [managed by iCloud Storage](/ios/lessons/0/#install-xcode). Then run the following command to clone the remote repo
```shell
git clone [your_repo_url.git] MDB-Mini-Projects
cd MDB-Mini-Projects
```
It's gonna show a warning that you have cloned an empty repository, which is expected because we haven't add anything to it yet. Let's quickly change that by adding a readme to the folder.
```shell
echo "# MDB Mini-Projects" >> README.md
```
This will create a file called `README.md` and append `"# MDB Mini-Projects"` to that file. However, we also need to register this change with Git. This is called *commit*. Think of it as creating a check point in game, so no matter how badly you mess up, you can always go back (well, most of the time :)).
```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "Added README.md"
```
Now if you run `git log`, you can actually see the commit you've made. 

Before we push the change to Github, let's make sure that the primary branch name follows the new standard (use `main` instead of `master`).

```shell
git branch -M main
```

Since this is the first time branch `main` is pushed to `origin` (the alias for your `repo_url.git`), we should also create the remote branch and make our local branch track that remote branch. So the next time we push, we only need to say `git push` rather than `git push origin main`.
```shell
git push -u origin main
```
In output it should say something like this 
```text
...
To https://github.com/Miclin1024/MDB-Mini-Projects.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```
Use `git open` to open the repository on Github, you should be able to see the `README.md` you just created.

## Get the Starter Code

Open a Terminal window, navigate to your local repository for the mini-projects. Run the following command
```shell
git remote add starter https://github.com/Miclin1024/MDB-Spring-21-iOS-TP.git
git pull starter main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
This should open your default CLI text editor asking you to confirm the merge. If you've never done anything to change it before, it should be `vim`.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-merge.png"
    alt="Create Github URL"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Press `:wq` to save and exit. If you accidentally enter the `Insert` mode, press `esc` to return to the command mode then press `:wq`.

Use `ls` to confirm that the folder `MP1 - Meet the Member` is in the repository. You can open the Finder window with `open .`. Double click the `Meet the Member.xcodeproj` file in the folder to open the project.

Throughout the project, we encourage you to commit frequently, so it's easy to revert to a prior commit if needed. Commits are usually broken down into functionality, so even if it's just a few lines, it might be worth to commit.

# Spec

## Requirements

For this project, you will be using Auto Layout to design each screen. That means you should be adding constraints instead of using frame for your layout. **You are not allowed to use the interface builder (storyboard).**

All screens must be designed well.

Note that the design of this application is entirely up to you, but make it look as clean as possible. See examples of trivia apps on the App Store for further inspiration.

Also note that this spec does not specify all of the smaller details that would make this a complete app. For example, the spec doesn’t require back buttons, but adding back buttons would make the app much easier to use. Build it in a way that would make you actually want to use it, and don’t make it “hacky” just because the spec doesn’t require something.

## Start Screen

- A screen with a button that says start. Upon pressing the button, the user is taken to the main screen.

## Main Screen

- **Member Picture**: Randomly display a picture of a member on the screen.
- **Name Options**: Display four options below the picture as buttons, each with different names that may correspond to the picture (one of the names should actually be correct, but the others can be random – be sure you don’t randomly also select the correct answer)
- **Score**: Display a score count for the user – when the user correctly answers, increase the score by 1. Otherwise, just move on to the next question.
- **Answer Display**: You can go from one question to another just by changing the image and button values, but there should be a one second delay in between questions where the button the user pressed flashes either red or green (depending on whether they’re correct or not). You’ll have to look up how to implement timers.
- **Timer**: Add an additional timer that limits the user to 5 seconds to answer the question. If they take up the full 5 seconds, the question is counted as incorrect. The user should have 2 seconds to read the correct answer before the next question is displayed. The 2 seconds count down will start when
    - The user tap a answer, whether that's correct or not, or
    - The 5 seconds countdown ends, whichever comes first
- **Pause Button**: When the main screen is first loaded, display a pause button. This button should display “Pause” when the game is running. When clicked on, the game should pause, and the pause button should change its display to “Resume.” When clicked on again, the game should unpause, and the score should reset. Additionally, the game should automatically pause if the user goes to a different screen.

## Statistics Screen

- **Statistics View**: Add a statistics icon. If the user clicks on this, the game should pause (if currently playing) and the screen should present a window that displays the following statistics:
    - Longest streak of correct answers
    - Result of last three questions (or less if not answered yet)

## Extra Credit

For 10pt of extra credits on MP1 (So the maximum possible is 110pt). Use an animated progress bar on the top of the screen to indicate the 5 seconds countdown. The progress bar should start with full and advance to the next level at the end of each second. The progress bar should be able to maintain at whatever its state {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} was during the 2 seconds countdown after the answer is displayed.

# Debugging

This guide will walk you through some of the common types of error that you will encounter, and general guidelines on how to debug in Xcode.

# Submission

Save all of the files in your project (easiest way to do that is just building/running it), and add them to the staging area 
```shell
git add -A
```
Commit the changes to git 
```shell
git commit -m "[Your commit message]"
```
When that's all done, push the local commits to Github 
```shell
git push
```
Recall that because we set up the branch tracking for our local `main`, we don't have to explicitly say `git push origin main`

Finally, submit your project to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)

# Project Description

Welcome to MDB! This semester, we’ll have over 50 members, including a new recruit class of 18 of the brightest minds on campus. What better way to get to know everyone in the club than to build an app about them? We’ll be building a simple, multiple-choice trivia game to see how fast you can learn everyone’s names.

You will be working alone for this project.

# Setup

For all of the mini-projects we will be using Git for source control, and you will need to have a [Github](http://github.com/) account. If you need a refresher on the Terminal commands, there's a cheat sheet [here](https://gist.github.com/poopsplat/7195274).

## Create a Github Repo

First go to your [Github](http://github.com/) and login to your account. On the left you should see the option to create a new repo.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-create.png"
    alt="Create Github Repo"
    style="width: 442px; display: block; margin: auto;" />

In the dialogue, pick a name for your repository. For example, it could be something like `MDB-Mini-Projects`. You can make it either public or private. You do not need to initialize it with README, .gitignore, or license.

After clicking create, your remote repo will be ready. You should see a URL ending with `.git`, this will be the remote reference of your repository.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-url.png"
    alt="Create Github URL"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Copy the URL. In your Terminal, first navigate to the directory where you want you local repo to be located (wondering how to do that? Check out the [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/poopsplat/7195274)). Again, do not use a directory that's [managed by iCloud Storage](/ios/lessons/0/#install-xcode). Then run the following command to clone the remote repo
```shell
git clone [your_repo_url.git] MDB-Mini-Projects
cd MDB-Mini-Projects
```
It's gonna show a warning that you have cloned an empty repository, which is expected because we haven't add anything to it yet. Let's quickly change that by adding a readme to the folder.
```shell
echo "# MDB Mini-Projects" >> README.md
```
This will create a file called `README.md` and append `"# MDB Mini-Projects"` to that file. However, we also need to register this change with Git. This is called *commit*. Think of it as creating a check point in game, so no matter how badly you mess up, you can always go back (well, most of the time :)).
```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "Added README.md"
```
Now if you run `git log`, you can actually see the commit you've made. 

Before we push the change to Github, let's make sure that the primary branch name follows the new standard (use `main` instead of `master`).

```shell
git branch -M main
```

Since this is the first time branch `main` is pushed to `origin` (the alias for your `repo_url.git`), we should also create the remote branch and make our local branch track that remote branch. So the next time we push, we only need to say `git push` rather than `git push origin main`.
```shell
git push -u origin main
```
In output it should say something like this 
```text
...
To https://github.com/Miclin1024/MDB-Mini-Projects.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```
Use `git open` to open the repository on Github, you should be able to see the `README.md` you just created.

## Get the Starter Code

Open a Terminal window, navigate to your local repository for the mini-projects. Run the following command
```shell
git remote add starter https://github.com/Miclin1024/MDB-Spring-21-iOS-TP.git
git pull starter main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
This should open your default CLI text editor asking you to confirm the merge. If you've never done anything to change it before, it should be `vim`.

<img src="/assets/images/github-repo-merge.png"

    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Press `:wq` to save and exit. If you accidentally enter the `Insert` mode, press `esc` to return to the command mode then press `:wq`.

Use `ls` to confirm that the folder `MP1 - Meet the Member` is in the repository. You can open the Finder window with `open .`. Double click the `Meet the Member.xcodeproj` file in the folder to open the project.

# Introduction
Five years ago, Niantic Labs took the world by storm when it released the high-tech, bug-free, not-at-all-laggy app Pokemon Go! Unfortunately, some people weren’t able to share in the excitement because they didn’t follow Pokemon as children and have no idea which one is which.

Let’s help those people out! This week we’ll be building a simple Pokedex app for people to look up statistics and information for over 800 Pokemon.

As in project 1, you will pull your starter code from the `starter` remote.

```bash
git pull starter main
```

This time you will be given much less starter code and instructions. Expect it to be more challenging than MP1, so please budget enough time to do it!

# Spec

## Requirements

For this project, you are required to use AutoLayout to create the UI. Your app should be easily navigable – for example, use navigation controllers to allow people to go to previous screens freely.

You are allowed to use storyboards. Though we still strongly recommend you create most of your UI programmatically.

Code quality is just as important as functionality! You should be consistent with the style guidelines for Swift.  Make your variable/function names clear and comment code when things are potentially confusing. Learn the content in this [guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)!

Note that the design of this application is entirely up to you, but make it look as clean as possible.

## Displaying the Pokemon
- When the user opens the app, they should see a list of all 800 Pokemon. You should display the following characteristics of each Pokemon
    - Name
    - Image
    - ID Number
- The user should be able to toggle between seeing the Pokemon in rows and seeing the Pokemon in a grid layout (n x 2 is fine)
    - HINT: Use `UICollectionView` with `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`, and control the size of each cell.
    - Challenge (15 Points EC): If you watched the WWDC videos ([WWDC19-215](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/215) and [WWDC19-220](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/220)) we mentioned in lesson 1, you can try making the collection view using `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` and `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource`. This will give you much prettier animations when designed correctly. **Do NOT attempt this method unless you are already confident of using UICollectionViewFlowLayout**.

## Pokemon Details
- When the user taps on a Pokemon, the app should bring them to a screen showing them the following characteristics of the Pokemon
    - Image
    - Name
    - ID
    - All of its statistics

## Search and Filtering
- Users should be able to search and filter pokemon to easily find what they want to see (because looking at 800+ Pokemon is a lot)
- On the main screen, include a search bar to search the Pokemon by name. As the user types in the search bar, the list of Pokemon should automatically update.
- If the user wants to filter on more criteria, they should be taken to a screen where they can filter on type.
    - Pokemon returned by the filter should satisfy **ALL** filter criteria (all the selected types + search string)

# Introduction

This week we’ll be exploring backend data storage/retrieval via Could Firestore. One of the cool features of Firestore over most other BaaS tools is its real-time functionality (in other words, Firestore automatically notifies you when some value in the database is updated). We’ll be building an app called MDBSocials which will allow members to post and RSVP to social events.

# Setup

## Package Management With CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a popular dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects. When you install a library using CocoaPods, you are not just installing the library itself. CocoaPods will analyse and install all the dependencies of that library, and help you integrate them to your source code.

### Install

Open Terminal and enter the following command
```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
Enter your password as requested. Note that the password you enter won't show on the screen, so just hit enter when you are done.

Finally, use this command to complete the setup
```shell
pod setup
```

## Starter Code

As usual, use this command to get the starter code
```shell
git pull starter main
```

Open the `MDB Social` folder, and install the CocoaPods
```shell
cd MDB\ Social
pod install
```

Use the `.xcworkspace` file to open the project

```shell
xed MDB\ Social.xcworkspace
```

We will be using Firebase Auth, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Storage for this mini-project. You should all have received an email invitation to collaborate on the firebase project. Do not change the document structure in Cloud Firestore because it could break the starter code for other people.

## Google Service Info Plist

To ensure that our data is only reachable by those who have access, Firebase use a `GoogleServiceInfo.plist` file to store all the tokens used to authenticate our app when communicating with the Firebase APIs. For the this reason, this file should always be excluded from the repository (by adding its name to `.gitignore`).

Therefore, this file is missing from the public repository where we keep our starter code and you will have to download it directly from Firebase. To get a copy of this file, you will go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and open the project page.

    alt="Firebase Setup"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Click the iOS app button that says "dev.mdb.MDB-Social-SP21". This is the bundle identifier of our app. Then click the gear icon.

<img src="/assets/images/firebase-setup-2.png"

    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Under the project settings page, click the `GoogleService-Info.plist` download button.

<img src="/assets/images/firebase-setup-3.png"
    alt="Firebase Setup"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

After that's done, you will move the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project's root folder as shown in the picture above. 

Go back to Xcode, under the project navigator, you should see the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file name turning from red to white, indicating that the file is now resolving correctly.

Run the app and make sure that you see the login screen. **Note: The build process can take about 2-5 minutes depending on your machine.**

    style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Finally, check if you can login using the dummy account.
```text
email: test@mdb.dev
password: 963258741
```

You can use the x button to go back to the authentication screen.

# Spec

## Requirements

You are allowed to use storyboards. Though we still strongly recommend you create most of your UI programmatically.

As always, good quality design is an expectation. Feel free to look at existing apps for inspiration. We will especially be looking for great design on this project so once you finish, please spend time improving your design.

Think carefully about navigation! Sometimes it might make more sense to present something modally than with the normal navigation controller. If you decide to use a navigation controller, remember to set it as the entry point in `SceneDelegate`. The user should always be able to navigate between screens freely.

Make sure your code is clean and easily readable. See [https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) for Swift style guide. We will be assessing you on your style in your code quality points.

## Sign Up

- The user should be brought to this screen when they hit the sign up button in the login page. Require the user to input their full name, email, username, password, and email when signing up.

- Once the user has filled out all the necessary info, they should tap the sign up button on this screen and be redirected to the `FeedNavigationVC`, which uses a `FeedVC` as its root view controller.

- The sign up should be done using the Firebase Auth service. See the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/start) for more details.

- When a user sign up, the app needs to first register the user with Firebase Auth, then use the `uid` returned from Firebase Auth to write the additional user information into [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/). You should use the dedicated `FIRDatabaseRequest` class to handle all the Firebase interaction. Feel free to change the methods that are already written in the `FIRDatabaseRequest` class.

- Note: We have added security rules to check if the request you send to Firebase is legal (credit to Allison for writing all the rules!!). If you are getting access errors when writing to/reading from firebase, double check if the information you are requesting to read/add is correct. (e.g. A user should only be able to access their own account info).

## Feed

- Display a list of socials where each cell contains the following information:
    - name of member who posted
    - name of event
    - picture of event
    - number of people who RSVP'd "interested"
- Socials should be displayed in order of most recent to oldest
- Any time someone creates a new event, this screen should automatically update (You won't be able to test this for now, but read through the [Cloud Firestore documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) and make sure that you are using the correct API!)

# Submission

Save all of the files in your project, commit, and push to Github.

Finally, submit your project to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)

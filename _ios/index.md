## Welcome ðŸŽ‰

In this training program, we will take you through the Apple technologies behind the _millions_ of Apps used by over _one billion_ iPhones around the world. While this course is fundamentally about building iOS Apps, it will often touch upon the big picture concepts -- such as modern programming paradigms, concurrency, memory management, database design and etc. We hope that this will help you develop the general software engineering knowledge which will help you no matter what career path you take in the future.

In terms of assignments, the iOS TP consists of 3 individual projects and a final group project. We will use [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) for submitting projects and assessing grades. You can also checkout lessons and projects details from the [archive](/ios-fa21/index/) from last semester.

## Software/Hardware Requirements

Because we will be developing and testing using native SDK, a Mac is _required_ for this training program. In addition, for your sanity during debugging, you Mac model should be from _2016 or later_. You should have _macOS Monterey (12.1+) and Xcode (13.0+)_ installed before coming to the first lesson.

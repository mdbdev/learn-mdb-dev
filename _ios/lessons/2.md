# Initialization

*Initialization* is the process of preparing an instance of a class, struct, or enum for use. This is the reason why previously we mentioned that we don't have access to `self` inside the closure initialization of our UI components - because it hasn't been *prepared* yet. In this section, we will discuss some important details of initialization in Swift.

## Initializers in Value Type

Initialization in value type is usually simpler than its counterpart due to the lack of inheritance. Suppose we have a `struct` called `Course`
```swift
struct Course {
    var name: String
    var code: String
}
```
An initializer is essentially a function denoted by the keyword `init`. In our case, it can look like this.
```swift
struct Course {
    var name: String
    var code: String

    init(name: String, code: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.code = code
    }
}
```
Notice that here `self` cannot be omitted because we have two local variables with the same names.

To make a new instance of `Course`, you simply call

```swift
let course = Course(
    name: "Introduction to Sophomore Mathematic Maturity",
    code: "CS 70"
)
```

The first important rule: An initializer must initialize **all** of its stored properties.

That is unless the property has a default value or is an optional. For example, the following code is also valid.
```swift
struct Course {
    var name: String
    var code: String = "CS 70"

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

## Initializers in Reference Type

Initialization for reference type (a.k.a class), however, is much more complex. The most obvious issue is, with the addition of class inheritance, we should no longer have a single initializer that initializes every property of that class, as some of them might be defined in its superclass, thus the *superclass* should be in charge of that part of the initialization. This is known as *initializer delegation*. To achieve this, Swift introduces two types of initializers for class type: *designated initializers* and *convenience initializers*.

### Designated and Convenience Initializers

Designated initializers are the main initializers for the class. It must initialize *all* properties introduced by the class and delegate the rest of the initialization to a *superclass* designated initializer. Designated initializers are declared with the `init` keyword.

Convenience initializers are secondary, supporting initializers for a class. A convenience initializer must eventually call a designated initializer from the *same* class. Convenience initializers are declared with `convenience init`. Following is an example of the initialization chain in terms of designated and convenience initializers.

    style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

In this more concrete example, we created a class `Person`, and another class `Student` which inherit from the `Person` class.
```swift
class Person {
    var id: String
    var name: String

    init(id: String, name: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
    }
}

class Student: Person {
    var year: Int

    init(withID id: String, name: String, year: Int) {
        self.year = year
        super.init(id: id, name: name)
    }
}
```
Note that in the `Student` initializer we initialize the property `self.year` before calling its superclass initializer.

However, there're valid use cases where we might have a *String* for `year` and it would be nice if our initializers can accept that as well. Without further complicating our designated initializer chain, we can use a convenience initializer to achieve this instead.

```swift
class Student: Person {
    var year: Int

    init(withID id: String, name: String, year: Int) {
        self.year = year
        super.init(id: id, name: name)
    }

    convenience init(withID id: String, name: String, year: String) {
        var yearNum = -1
        switch year {
        case "Freshman": yearNum = 1
        case "Sophomore": yearNum = 2
        case "Junior": yearNum = 3
        case "Senior": yearNum = 4
        default: yearNum = -1
        }
        
        self.init(withID: id, name: name, year: yearNum)
    }
}
```

and you might recall that we can further simplify this with enumerations.

```swift
class Student: Person {

    enum Year: String, CaseIterable {
        case freshman
        case sophomore
        case junior
        case senior
    }
    
    var year: Int

    init(withID id: String, name: String, year: Int) {
        self.year = year
        super.init(id: id, name: name)
    }
    
    convenience init?(withID id: String, name: String, year: String) {
        guard let year = Year(rawValue: year.lowercased()) else { return nil }
        guard let yearNum = Year.allCases.lastIndex(of: year) else { return nil }
        
        self.init(withID: id, name: name, year: yearNum)
    }
}
```

The `?` in `convenience init?` indicates that it is a *failable initializer*, which handles the case where the String passed in cannot be synthesized into a `Student.Year` instance.

### Two-Phase Initialization

Class initialization is carried out in a *two-phase process*. In the first phase, Swift works its way up the initializers chain and initializes every stored property. After that's done, in the second phase, the runtime returns back from the top of the chain, and each initializer is given the opportunity to customize its stored properties even further before the instance is returned.

```swift
init(withID id: String, name: String, year: Int) {
    /* First Phase */
    self.year = year
    super.init(id: id, name: name)
    
    /* Second Phase*/
}

convenience init?(withID id: String, name: String, year: String) {
    /* First Phase */
    guard let year = Year(rawValue: year.lowercased()) else { return nil }
    guard let yearNum = Year.allCases.lastIndex(of: year) else { return nil }
    
    self.init(withID: id, name: name, year: yearNum)
    /* Second Phase*/
}
```

The biggest difference between the two phases is the availability of `self`. In the first phase, the use of `self` is very limited, and can only be used inside the designated initializers to assign value to a stored property introduced in the class. For example, the following use of `self` is not allowed even if it might seem harmless.

```swift
convenience init?(withID id: String, name: String, year: String) {
    /* ... */
    self.year = yearNum
    self.init(withID: id, name: name, year: yearNum)
}
```

In the second phase, these restrictions are removed and you can alter property values and even call instance methods using `self`.

The reason behind this is to prevent property values from being used before they are initialized, while still giving flexibility to the initialization process.


# Automatic Reference Counting
You can think of *Automatic Reference Counting* (ARC) as the garbage collector in Swift. It is a framework used to track and manage the memory of your App. 

As you may already know by now, classes in Swift are passed by reference. That means when you initialize a class instance, the runtime allocates a chunk of memory in a special location known as *heap*, and returns to you a reference pointing to that chunk of memory. You can duplicate or move or pass that pointer around any way you like, but the physical instance of the class is always going to be in the same location in memory. This helps keep passing class instances lightweight as it only involves copying the pointers. 

However, when there's no reference pointing to that instance, the instance becomes unusable and needs to be released from memory, because otherwise they would just slowly build up until our memory is full. You will learn more about this in CS 61C.

Therefore, ARC was introduced to be aware of the number of references pointing to each class instance and release it when the reference count reaches zero.

## Reference Cycle

However, this does create a problem. Consider the following classes
```swift
class Foo {
    var bar: Bar?
    init() { self.bar = Bar(foo: self) }
}

class Bar {
    var foo: Foo
    init(foo: Foo) { self.foo = foo }
}

var foo: Foo? = Foo()
foo = nil
```
The variable `bar` is declared as optional because it has to be initialized in phase two rather than phase one.

You will notice that once initialized, `foo` holds a reference to a `Bar` instance, which also has a reference to `foo`. Then when we discard the reference to `foo` by saying `foo = nil`, the Foo and Bar instances will still have one reference pointing to each other. As a result, they will never be collected by the ARC despite that there's technically no way for us to use the two instances anymore. This is known as a *reference cycle* and is a terrible, terrible programming practice.

## Strong and Weak References

So how do we solve this? Fortunately, it is relatively straightforward, we just have to be careful. It turns out that ARC keeps track of two kinds of references: *strong references* and *weak references*. When it counts, it **only** counts the strong references to determine whether to deinitialize an instance. Our regular variables use strong references by default, and we need to explicitly declare them using the `weak` keyword if we are going to use weak references.

```swift
class Foo {
    var bar: Bar?
    init() { self.bar = Bar(foo: self) }
}

class Bar {
    weak var foo: Foo?
    init(foo: Foo) { self.foo = foo }
}

var foo: Foo? = Foo()
foo = nil
```

When we run `foo = nil`, the instance `foo` will have zero strong reference, so it will be deinitialized first. After that, without the `bar` variable in `foo` pointing to `bar`, the `bar` instance will also have zero strong reference, causing it to be collected as well.

However, there is one little side effect: because the variable using weak reference can not guarantee to be pointing to a valid instance, it has to be declared as an optional.

# Grand Central Dispatch

Everything we've learned so far is executed linearly in a place known as the *main thread*. The name *thread* comes from the fact that instructions are lined up to be executed one by one, and the previous line has to finish in order for the program to move on to the next line. This is oftentimes preferable as our next line may be dependent on the results of the previous lines. The *main thread* is used for all UI updates such as the scrolling effect of the collection view in *Pokédex*.

However, if an instruction takes too long to execute, the entire thread would just freeze. This is known as *blocking*. Blocking can be a big issue when you are executing an expensive operation or during a network request. Since these operations may take a long time to finish, if we do it on the *main thread*, our UI would be completely unresponsive during that time.

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "image_source_url") else { return }
guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) else { return }
cell.imageView.image = UIImage(data: data)
```

Above is a naive way of loading a remote image into the cell. If you try this with your collection view cells in Pokédex, you should see your app getting "choppy" when scrolling - they are the effect of fetching data on the main queue.

The solution (at least a part of it) is the *Grand Central Dispatch* (GCD), a framework that facilitates multithreading in Swift and Objective-C.

In other languages you might've learned such as Python or Java, programmers typically have to spawn in and manage these threads themselves. But spawning new threads on the run is expensive, and managing them can be quite tricky and tedious (see [this](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/CreatingThreads/CreatingThreads.html) prehistoric doc). Therefore, the engineers at Apple developed a solution using a centralized dispatch system, and here is a simplified version of how it works:

Instead of spawning the threads ourselves, they are created and managed by the framework. In return, GCD gives us access to two types of globally available dispatch queues: the main queue and the global queues. So whenever we need to run a task, we send it to one of the queues, and it will then dispatch it to the appropriate threads. You can create your own dispatch queue if you want, but we will not get into that in this lesson.

## Main Dispatch Queue

The main dispatch queue is a globally available serial queue that executes tasks on the application’s main thread. It is a *serial queue*, meaning that all tasks will be executed in the order in which they were added to the queue. This is where all of our code is executed by default. All UI-related code must happen on this thread, so as we said, you want to be careful not to block your main queue with time-expensive tasks. You can access the main queue using `DispatchQueue.main`.

## Global Dispatch Queues

Unlike the main queue which is backed by only one queue and one thread, there're four predefined global queues available to use, and each of them manages a set of threads. Global queues are *concurrent queues*, meaning that even though tasks are still started in the order in which they were added to the queue, the queue can execute multiple tasks at once.

The four predefined global queues are identified by their *Quality of Service* (QoS), and can be accessed by calling `DispatchQueue.global(qos:)`. GCD uses QoS to adjust tasks priority and maintains a balance between performance and energy efficiency. The four QoS identifiers are:

- `.userInteractive`: Tasks related to interacting with the user, such as operating on the main thread or refreshing the UI. If the operation doesn't happen quickly, the user interface may appear frozen. This QoS class has the highest priority among the four.
- `.userInitiated`: Tasks that the user initiated and requires immediate results, such as opening a saved document. Tasks in `.userInteractive` and `.userInitiated` should always be almost instantaneous.
- `.utility`: Tasks that may take some time to complete (a few seconds to a few minutes). An example would be downloading data from a remote source.
- `.background`: Tasks that operate in the background and aren't visible to the user, such as indexing, synchronizing, and backups. 

## Async vs. Sync

When sending tasks to a dispatch queue, you can choose whether the tasks are executed *synchronously* or *asynchronously* with respect to the **caller**. 

This video will walk you through the difference between sync and async using an example of loading a `UIImage`

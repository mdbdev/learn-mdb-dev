# Local Data Persistence

A few weeks ago we talked about Cloud Firestore, an NoSQL cloud database that can store and sync data from your app, and we used it in MP3 to create an social App where you can create and share event details amongst other user. But that's a big jump - not always we would want to store our data in a remote server. In some use cases, storing your data locally is much more efficient and less error-prone. 

A classic example of where you would want to use local data storage is user's settings. Assuming that you don't care about syncing user settings between different devices, there's no point of uploading them to a remote server. Another example could be when the data is too large to store on a server such as a movies or a bunch of photos, in which case you have no choice but to keep them locally.

## File Manager

The first local storage option that we will look at today is the *file system*. Just as most desktop OS, in iOS files are organized into many directories. In MP2, we used a `pokemon.json` file from our app's bundle folder to generate an array of `Pokemon` objects.

```swift
guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "pokemons", 
                                withExtension: "json") else { ... }

guard let jsonData = try? Data(contentsOf: url) as Data else { ... }
```

When Xcode builds the app, it creates a `bundle` object that contains all the binaries, resources, and extra files in the project. It organizes your ap p into a well-defined package, so that when people download it from the App Store, they only need to download the (main) bundle into their file system. And as you saw in MP2, with bundles, we can access its content without knowing the structure of the bundle, which makes it great for static resource files like images and our `pokemon.json`.

<img src="/assets/images/copy-bundle-resource.png"
    alt="Bundle resource"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

However, bundles are *read only* and are deleted with the app. Therefore, if you are looking to write back to the file system, you will have to interact with other os directories.

Luckily, it turns out that is also simple, you just have to use the `FileManager` class.

```swift
guard let url = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
    .first!.appendingPathComponent("pokemon.json") else { ... }

guard let jsonData = try? Data(contentsOf: url) else { ... }
```

This reads the `pokemon.json` from the document directory under the user domain (`~`).

Writing to the url is even more straightforward:

```swift
try jsonData.write(to: url)
// Error handling
```

See, no opening and closing file or managing buffer. That's why I love Swift.

## User Defaults

Being able to manage files is great, but sometimes, it can be an overkill too. What if you just want to store a few app settings or flags (like whether it's the app's first launch).

This is where [`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) comes to the rescue. It gives you the ability to store key-value pairs to the user's internal database. For example, you can store the default layout for your Pokemon collection view like this

```swift
UserDefaults.standard.set("grid", forKey: "pokemonLayout")
```

and to get the value:

```swift
let layoutRaw = NSUserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "pokemonLayout") ?? "row"
let layout = PokemonLayout(rawValue: layoutRaw)
```

Notice that the getter returns an optional string, so we can use the nil-coalescing operator `??` to provide a default value.

Behind the scene, your data is persisted through a `.plist` file in the app's package. This means that User Defaults can only store `NSData`, `NSString`, `NSNumber`, `NSDate`, `NSArray`,`NSDictionary`, or their Swift counterparts, because these are the types allowed in a property list. Though you can typically store other types by converting them into an instance of `NSData`.

# App's Life Cycle

In this section we will bring our attention to the two files that we've been kind of ignoring so far: `AppDelegate` and `SceneDelegate`. These are the files that are responsible for responding to the transition events between *states* of the app, known as *life cycles*.

<img src="/assets/images/app-delegate.png"
    alt="App Delegate in iOS"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

At a high level, these are just like delegate objects, telling you what's happening with your app. But in practice, there're a lot more details than you would expect. While we are not going to get into too much of that, it is important that you learn the basics as it will give you a much better picture of what's going on behind the curtain.

<img src="https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c63cd35863/4d403429-fa30-4706-863f-5e3617ee21d0.png"
    alt="Managing your App's Life Cycle"
    style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Background

Before iOS 12, each app can only have one instance running on foreground at any given time. So UIKit delivers all life-cycle events to the `UIApplicationDelegate` object in `AppDelegate.swift`. It works with `UIApplication` and you can think of it as the "root" of the App. Previously, the app delegate would have access to a `UIWindow` object where the app's root view controller will reside. But on iOS 12 Apple added a new feature that allows multiple instances of your app's UI simultaneously.

<img src="https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8ce996907a/fc0975ae-c186-438c-abdd-5280f650c377.png"
    alt="App Delegate in iOS"
    style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

This means that an app may have to manage more than one life cycles and windows at the same time, which is why after iOS 12, we have a new concept called `scene`. A scene manages an instance of your app's UI and its life cycle just as the app delegate did before. In other words, We still only have one "app", but now we can have multiple "scenes" running under that app.

## Using Life Cycle Methods

Despite the convoluted system of scenes and life cycle events, using the life cycle methods itself is pretty straightforward. Just put the code that you want to execute in the life cycle functions, and it will be triggered when the corresponding events occur. One that we've already used is the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method. We implemented a simple check in MP3 to see if an user has already logged in.

```swift
class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegates {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

        guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
        window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
        window?.windowScene = windowScene
        if FIRAuthProvider.shared.isSignedIn() {
            let vc = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil).instantiateInitialViewController()
            window?.rootViewController = vc
        } else {
            let vc = UIStoryboard(name: "Auth", bundle: nil).instantiateInitialViewController()
            window?.rootViewController = vc
        }
        window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
    }

    /* ... */
}
```

# Modern Collection View

## Compositional Layout

In Lesson 1 we talked about using `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`, a subclass of `UICollectionViewLayout`, to create a collection view that displays cells in a line-based layout.

<img src="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/CollectionViewPGforIOS/Art/flow_horiz_layout_uneven_2x.png"
    alt="Flow layout"
    style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Today we will introduce another layout class called `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout`. It's used to create more complex layout pattern that cannot be achieved through flow layout. A compositional layout is composed of one or more *sections*. Each section breaks up into *groups*. A group consists of individual *items*, which are the smallest unit of layout, or it can also consist of other groups.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/appstore-collection-view.jpeg"

    style="width: 35%; display: inline-block; margin: auto;" />

<img src="https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2308306163/rendered2x-1585241228.png"
    alt="Section, groups, and items in collection view layout"
    style="width: 45%; display: inline-block; margin: auto;" />
</div>

### Item

Items are the smallest unit of layout. It is described by a `layoutSize:` parameter, which specify the size of that item.
It takes an instance of `NSCollectionLayoutSize`, which has only one initializer: `NSCollectionLayoutSize(widthDimension:heightDimension:)`. The for each dimension, you will pass in an `NSCollectionLayoutDimension` object. `NSCollectionLayoutDimension` is the core of compositional layout. It allows you to specify dimension size in four ways:
- `.absolute(_:)`: An absolute value equal to the CGFloat that you pass in.
- `.fractionalWidth(_:)`: A fractional value (0-1) with respect to the width dimension of the enclosing layout object (a group, a section, etc.)
- `.fractionalHeight(_:)`: A fractional value (0-1) with respect to the height dimension of the enclosing layout object (a group, a section, etc.)
- `.estimated(_:)`: An estimated value, meaning it won't stop the inside layout object from grow bigger or smaller.

So for example, assuming our enclosing object is a row that takes the full width of the section as well as the screen (will talk about that in a moment), a square cell that fits into one fifth of the row space can be defined as follow:
```swift
let itemSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(1/5),
                                      heightDimension: .fractionalWidth(1/5))
let item = NSCollectionLayoutItem(layoutSize: itemSize)
```

You can customize it a bit further by changing some of its properties
```swift
item.contentInsets = NSDirectionalEdgeInsets(top: 1, leading: 2, 
                                             bottom: 3, trailing: 4)

item.edgeSpacing = NSCollectionLayoutEdgeSpacing(leading: .flexible(40), 
                                                 top: .fixed(10), 
                                                 trailing: .flexible(40), 
                                                 bottom: .fixed(0))
```

Here the `NSDirectionalEdgeInset` is very similar to `UIEdgeInset`, the only difference is that directional edge inset accounts for the text direction of the current language settings. (btw this is also the difference between leading/trailing vs left/right anchors in Auto Layout). The edge spacing however, is a bit more mysterious. Unlike content inset, it specify the outer spacing of the content box. If you are familiar with web design and CSS that sort of stuff, it's like the difference between margin and padding - with a little iOS twist. For each edge in edge spacing, you can choose between a fixed or a flexible value. The fixed values work just like you would expect. The flexible values will make the space greater than or equal to the given point value, depending on whether there's extra space.

### Group

Group is the intermediate layer and the backbone of our collection view. Since groups can encapsulate items as well as other groups, it can be used to create very complex layers of layout. But let's start with a simple simple use case. Suppose we want to create a row that can fit the items we just defined. To create a layout group, we will use the `NSCollectionLayoutGroup` class, which comes with two factory methods: `NSCollectionLayoutGroup.horizontal(layoutSize:subitems:)` and `NSCollectionLayoutGroup.vertical(layoutSize:subitems:)`. Since we creating rows, we will use the horizontal one (again we are assuming that the section takes the full screen width. However, it doesn't actually matter if it's smaller as everything is defined using fractions).
```swift
let rowGroupSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(1.0),
                                       heightDimension: .fractionalWidth(1/5))
let rowGroup = NSCollectionLayoutGroup
                .horizontal(layoutSize: rowGroupSize, subitems: [item])
```
The `subitems: [item]` argument defines what's in the group. You can put any items and/or groups in the array. The actual array of of objects will be automatically extended to fill the space within the group. For example, if the subitems are `[item1, group2]`, and the group has space for two of them plus a `item1`, the actual objects inside will be `[item1, group2, item1, group2, item1]`

Alternatively, you can use a variant of the two methods `NSCollectionLayoutGroup.vertical(layoutSize:subitem:count:)` or `NSCollectionLayoutGroup.horizontal(layoutSize:subitem:count:)`. In this case you can only use one type of subitem (either an item or another group). In addition, the layout will override the child's width or height dimension if necessary to achieve the number of objects you specified for that group. So if instead of saying `layoutSize: rowGroupSize, subitems: [item]` like we did in the previous code snippet, we wrote

```swift
let rowGroup = NSCollectionLayoutGroup
                .horizontal(layoutSize: rowGroupSize, subitem: item, count: 6)
```
Even if we define the items width dimension to be of fraction width **1/5**, the actual width would be fractional width **1/6**, because it would be overrode by the `count: 6` in `rowGroup`.

Just like items, groups have several properties which you can customize. In addition to the content insets and edge spacing that we mentioned before. Group allows you to specify the spacing between each of the two objects, and it too has either a fixed or a flexible value.
```swift
rowGroup.interItemSpacing = .flexible(20)
```

### Section

Finally, we've reached the sections. To instantiate a section, you simply need

```swift
let section = NSCollectionLayoutSection(group: group)
```

After you initialize the section, you could define the header, footer, and one of my all time favorite: the orthogonal scrolling behavior. This gives you the ability scroll through the groups in a section orthogonal to the scrolling direction (vertical by default) of your collection view. And this is what Apple did in the Apple Store app, allowing you to scroll vertically through the collection view, and horizontally through each section.

```swift
section.orthogonalScrollingBehavior = .groupPaging
```

There's no need to specify the size of the section because the size will determined by auto layout and the scrolling direction of the collection view. For example, if the collection view's scrolling direction is vertical, and the width of the view is set by constraints to be the full width of the screen, our section would have the width of the screen. In the case where there's no orthogonal scrolling, the groups in that section will stack vertically and grow towards the bottom. If there is orthogonal scrolling, the groups will then grow orthogonally towards the trailing edge, where the users will be able to scroll to according to the scrolling behavior.

### Putting it Together

Now that you've learned the basics of compositional layout, how do we put them together into a `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` object? For the single section, 5 x N grid layout that we described above, you probably only need the `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout(section:)` initializer. But in case you want to have section based layout, Apple has also packed the section provider initializer `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout(sectionProvider:)`. The provider is a closure that takes two positional arguments: an integer section index, and a layout environment object that has the current layout container and the trait collection of the app. You can use that to dynamically generate your layout based on section, interface size class, or device type.

You can also provide a `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayoutConfiguration` object along with the section or section provider, which specifies property such as scrolling direction, inter-section spacing, etc.

## Diffable Data Source

Another advancement that Apple made with regard to collection view is the diffable data source. Previously when applying changes to a collection view, we rely on index path to obtain the instance of the cell. But this model isn't very robust. Because as cells are being reused and relocated, index paths are being changed all the time. So it typically leads to a lot of bookkeeping and programing errors.

Diffable data source eliminate those concerns by using a hashable identifier object to identify each cell. Normally this would be the items that you would display in a cell, such as a user, an event, etc. Each object will be associated with a collection view section which we discussed earlier in compositional layout. The only requirement is that the object must implement the hashable protocol, and the hash must be unique for different objects. Since in most app you would already have a unique identifier for the model objects, this usually wouldn't be an issue. For example, consider the following `Event` struct.

```swift
struct Event {
    let uid: String   
    let name: String
    /* ... */
}
```

To refactor for diffable data source, we simply add the protocol conformance and an updated hash method.

```swift
struct Event: Hashable {
    let uid: String
    let name: String
    /* ... */
    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        hasher.combine(uid)
    }
}
```

After this is done, you will configure your data source in the view controller. One of the biggest changes in diffable data source is that it's no longer implemented through protocol, instead, it uses an generic object `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<SectionIdentifierType, ItemIdentifierType>`. The item identifier would just be the hashable class or struct that you just made. For the section identifier, usually it would just be an enumeration type with the possible sections. For example, if we just want one section for our collection we would write:

```swift
class EventCollectionVC: UIViewController {
    enum Section { case main }
    /* ... */
}
```

Since our data source is now an object, we will need to keep a reference to it so that it doesn't get deallocated and also in case we need it later.

```swift
class EventCollectionVC: UIViewController {
    /* ... */
    var dataSource: UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Event>!
}
```

Finally, after all these setups are completed, we will then generate the compositional layout, initialize the collection view, configure the data source, and apply the initial *snapshot* to the data source. Snapshots are the core of diffable data source. It reflects what you want each section in the collection view to display at that given point. When you apply a snapshot to the data source, the data source automatically performs a diff between the incoming and the current snapshot, and figure out what needs to be changed. 

Diffable data source is initialized with the `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<SectionIdentifierType, ItemIdentifierType>(collectionView:cellProvider:)` initializer. The collection view argument is just the collection view that you want to use the data source for, and the cell provider is again a closure, which takes three positional arguments: the collection view instance, a index path, and the identifier. The closure returns a `UICollectionViewCell` just like before in the data source protocol.

Following is a simplified example of the workflow.

```swift
class EventCollectionVC: UIViewController {
    enum Section { case main }

    var eventCollectionView: UICollectionView!
    var dataSource: UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Event>!
}

extension EventCollectionVC {
    func generateLayout() -> UICollectionViewLayout {
        /* ... */
    }

    func configureCollectionView() {
        eventCollectionView = UICollectionView(frame: view.bounds, 
                                               collectionViewLayout: generateLayout())
        /* customization, cell registration, etc. */
        view.addSubview(eventCollectionView)
    }

    func configureDataSource() {
        dataSource = UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Event>(collectionView: eventCollectionView) {
            (collectionView: UICollectionView, indexPath: IndexPath, identifier: Event) -> UICollectionViewCell? in
            /* Initialize and configure a cell */
            return cell
        }
        dataSource.apply(generateSnapshot(), animatingDifferences: false)
    }

    func generateSnapshot() -> NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot<Section, Event> {
        var snapshot = NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot<Section, Event>()
        snapshot.appendSection([.main])
        snapshot.appendItems(/* The event objects */)
        return snapshot
    }
}
```

# The End

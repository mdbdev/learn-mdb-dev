### Welcome!
The MDB Training Program is a 6-week, all-intensive course in iOS, Android, or React Native mobile development led by MDB instructors and mentors. On this site, we've published our React Native Training Program, which was developed in Fall 2020.

This course contains six lectures, five mini-projects, one midterm assessment, and one final assessment. The lectures and starter code for the mini projects are public. Solutions to the mini projects, as well as assessments, are accessible only to members.

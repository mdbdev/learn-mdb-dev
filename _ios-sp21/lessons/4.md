# Notification Center

Recall that in MP2, when the Pokemon collection view needs data or layout information, it will fetch that information from the `PokedexVC`, who is the delegate of that collection view and implements the `UICollectionViewDataSource` and `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout` protocols. And under the hood the implementation is actually very simple:

<img src="/assets/images/mkcalendar-delegate.png"
    alt="Calendar Delegate"
    style="width: 90%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

The example above is very similar to the `didSelectCellAt` and `didDeselectCellAt` delegate methods we've seen in collection views. In this scenario, whenever the calendar needs to notify its delegate that the user has just selected a `Date`, it simply calls `delegate?.calendar(self, date)`. 

The delegation pattern is a simple yet powerful tool for one-to-one communication between two objects. However, this method becomes kind of limited when one-to-more communication is needed. It is true that what can do something like this:
```swift
var delegates: [MKCalendarDelegate] = []

```
But then we realize that we need weak references to avoid retain cycle. So we'd have to use `NSPointerArray` or some kind of wrapper class like this one
```swift
var delegates: [Weak<MKCalendarDelegate>] = []

class Weak<T: AnyObject> {
    weak var val: T?
    init (val: T) { self.val = val }
}
```
and instead of calling `delegate?.calendar(self, date)`, our call would become
```swift
delegates.compactMap({ $0.val }).calendar(self, date)
```
It gets worse when we want to remove a delegate from the list. Previously, we just need to set `delegate` to `nil`. Now we have to do a reference based comparison for removal:
```swift
delegates.removeAll(where: { $0 === self })
```
The three equals (`===`) is a Swift operator that tests whether two references point to the same object instances.

There are other limitations such as when an instance is deeply encapsulated in some other code, it would become almost impossible to reach that instance and assign the delegate.

All of these mean that our old delegate method of using a protocol and a weak variable probably won't cut it: we need something more complicated. Hence the *Notification Center* was born. Provided under the Foundation framework, Notification Center is a centralized mechanism for dispatching notification to registered *observers*.

Just like using a delegate, sending and receiving notifications is pretty straightforward.

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Notification.Name("didFinishedSignIn"), object: nil)
```

This post a notification with the name `didFinishedSignIn`.

To observe this notification, you just need

```swift
NotificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector(didFinishedSignIn(_:)), name: Notification.Name("didFinishedSignIn"), object: nil)
```

Every time when somebody posts a notification with the name `Notification.Name("didFinishedSignIn")`, the objective-c function `didFinishedSignIn(_:)` will be triggered through the selector.

Now you've probably noticed in the example we typed in `"didFinishedSignIn"` twice. This is vulnerable to typos. Therefore, for type safety, it is common practice to declare the notification name as a static or instance variable of a class or struct, or simply just as an extension of `Notification.Name`. For instance

```swift
extension Notification.Name {
    static let didFinishedSignIn = Notification.Name("didFinishedSignIn")
}
```

so when we need to use the notification, we can just refer to it as `.didFinishedSignIn`

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .didFinishedSignIn, object: nil)
```

The following video take you through a very classic use case for notification center.

# Custom View

So far you are probably comfortable with customizing UIKit build-in views through tinkering with their properties. Custom views take it one step further by subclassing and composing one or more views together into a new type of component. It allows you to encapsulate a complex view hierarchy into a single view object, which gives you much greater code reusability.

<img src="/assets/images/auth-text-field.png"
    alt="Auth Text Field in MP3"
    style="width: 75%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Above is a custom view we have in MP3 starter code, it comprises a `UILabel` and a `UITextField`. When we want to use it, all we need to do is to call the initializer, which is defined in the custom view.

```swift
AuthTextField(title: "Email:")
```

But before we can dive into how to create a custom view, we will need to learn a few basic layout concepts.

## Constraint Priority

As we mentioned in the notification center video, every constraint is associated with a *priority*. By default, the constraints you define have the maximum priority *required*. 

<img src="/assets/images/constraint-priority-xcode.png"
    alt="Constraint Priority in Xcode"
    style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notice the `@1000` at the end of each constraint on the left. It is the *raw value* of the priority of that constraint, which is a `Float` number ranging from 0 to 1000. Constraints with a priority of 1000 are the ones that are required. Anything below 1000 means the constraint is optional.

This is also where constraint conflicts occur: it happens when Auto Layout cannot satisfy all *required* constraints simultaneously. Conversely, for constraints with less than required priority level, it can break without triggering a conflict.

As you've seen in the notification center demo, optional constraints are a powerful tool for creating flexible UI. One thing I always like to do is to think of them as springs. They will push or pull the UI towards their defined length or position, and will give way to other constraints with higher priority, which allows you to specify the order of which different parts of the UI extend or compress.

To set the priority of a constraint, use the [`priority`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nslayoutconstraint/1526946-priority) variable defined under `NSLayoutConstraint`

```swift
bottomInsetConstraint.priority = .init(rawValue: 700)
```

Although you can manually create a priority using its initializer and raw value, more often we will choose from one of the predefined values such as `.defaultHigh`, which has a priority of 750.

```swift
bottomInsetConstraint.priority = .defaultHigh
```

## Intrinsic Content Size

From the previous demos and projects, you might discover that we don't always have to use constraints to define the size of a view.

<img src="/assets/images/mp3-ios-signin.png"
    alt="MP3 iOS Sign In Screen"
    style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

For example in the MP3 starter code, we didn't define the height of any of the controls. Yet the views still automatically extend to fit their content. This is because some views like labels and buttons have a natural size which can be inferred from their current content. This is referred to as their *intrinsic content size*. It tells Auto Layout what is its preferred size based on the current content. For example, a buttonâ€™s preferred size is the size of its title plus a small padding on each side.

<img src="/assets/images/intrinsic-content-size.png"
    alt="Intrinsic Content Size for Common Controls"
    style="width: 90%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

You can override the default computation of a view's intrinsic content size

```swift
override var intrinsicContentSize: CGSize {
    // Calculate w and h
    return CGSize(width: w, height: h)
}
```

Then call [`invalidateIntrinsicContentSize()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622457-invalidateintrinsiccontentsize) whenever something changes that affects the intrinsic content size. The method will notify Auto Layout to recalculate the frame based on the new content size.

## Content Hugging and Compression Resistance

Behind the scene, intrinsic content size is translated into two pairs of optional inequality constraints known as *content hugging* and *compression resistance*.

```text
view.height >= intrinsicContentSize.height @750
view.width >= intrinsicContentSize.width @750

view.height <= intrinsicContentSize.height @250
view.width <= intrinsicContentSize.width @250
```

The two compression resistance constraints have the priority `defaultHigh` at 750, whereas the content hugging constraints have priority of `defaultLow` at 250. Intuitively, this means that it's easier to stretch a view than it is to shrink it, which is what you want most of the time.

You can set the priority of any of the four constraints using the [`setContentCompressionResistancePriority(_:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622526-setcontentcompressionresistancep) and [`setContentHuggingPriority(_:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622485-setcontenthuggingpriority) methods. For example

```swift
view.setContentCompressionResistancePriority(.init(rawValue: 749), for: .vertical)
```

This sets the view's compression resistance priority to be slightly below others', so when Auto Layout is solving for the constraint system, it will be the first one to collapse.

Understanding these concepts can help you leverage the layout process and is crucial to creating a highly robust and reusable views.

## Creating a Custom View

Custom views are created through subclassing an existing view. It could be any known `UIView` subclass such as the build-in controls like `UILabel` or `UIButton`, container views `UIStackView`, or even another custom view you defined. We will use the `AuthTextField` from MP3 starter as our example.

```swift
final class AuthTextField: UIView { ... }

AuthTextField(title: "Email:")
```

<img src="/assets/images/auth-text-field.png"
    alt="Auth Text Field in MP3"
    style="width: 75%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

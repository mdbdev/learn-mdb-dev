## Welcome to React Native

The modern world has shifted towards mobile. The web has been replaced by the browser, and the desktop has been replaced by the phone. There is a growing need for cross-platform development not as a feature, but as a requirement to access the over _three billion_ Androids and over _one billion_ iPhones around the world in addition to over _two billion_ computers running Windows, macOS, and Linux.

In the past, multiple codebases in multiple languages (Swift, Kotlin, Java, Objective-C, C#, etc.) were required to develop for multiple platforms. By using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), you can develop a single codebase in JavaScript and use it to develop for both Android and iOS. Additionally, you can use the same codebase to develop for the web using [React](https://reactjs.org/), and even Desktop apps using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) or newer projects like [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

In this training program, you will learn how to use React Native and build purely in Typescript, a superset of Javascript, to create cross-platform mobile apps. Along the way, you will also learn backend architecture, database paradigms, systems design, wireframing, authentication paradigms, web development (extending React Native concepts), and much more.

## Software/Hardware Requirements

No specific operating system is mandatory, but you will need a computer with a good internet connection. It is recommended that you use Visual Studio Code, a free and open-source IDE, to develop your apps. Additionally, you will need a phone with the Expo Go app installed or an emulator that can be accessed from the Expo Command Line Tool.
